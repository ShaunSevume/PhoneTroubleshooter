My first programming project, undertaken during my GCSE Computer Science course. I achieved full marks for this!
Each folder contains the source code for each iteration of the program, as well as a txt file containing a brief description of the program's functionalities. Each pdf file is my documentation of the Software's Development lifecycle, focusing on the Analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing of the program.
